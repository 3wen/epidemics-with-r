Modelling epidemics with R


As Michel likes to emphasize, our offices are located in a triangle within the
[Aix Marseille School of Economics (AMSE)](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en)
department of Aix Marseille Universit√©, so we couldn't be closer. However, it
was not until the lockdown brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic that we
actually started working together. The COVID-19 pandemic, despite all the
disasters it has brought upon a lot of people, has had at least one positive
externality for us --it has prompted remote discussions. We have spent a lot of
time exploring the use of entirely new methods for each of us. Through this
ebook, we aim to share the knowledge we have gained during this period. There
may be errors in the codes provided, so if you spot any, please don't hesitate
to point them out to us.
